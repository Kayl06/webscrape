He was flanked by his fellow-lawyers and by Dominion’s executives; just behind them, a man in camouflage cargo shorts held a sign that read “FOX + GOP = FASCIST PROPAGANDA.” “Lies have consequences,” Nelson said. “The truth does not know red or blue.” He framed Dominion’s victory not just as a matter of money but a win for American civic integrity. “For our democracy to endure for another two hundred and fifty years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts,” Nelson said. “Misinformation will not go away. It may only get worse.”Ever since Sunday night, when Judge Davis delayed the start of the trial by a day, Wilmington had been a hotbed of speculation about whether the proceedings would go forward. Many of Fox’s arguments had been crippled in pretrial hearings, and the company was facing the likelihood that some of its top stars, including Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, would be called to testify, along with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the father-and-son pair who run Fox News’ parent company. Tents had been set up behind the court to shield the expected high-profile witnesses from view as they entered and exited the courthouse. No photos or recording were allowed inside the courtroom, but Rupert Murdoch, who is ninety-two, would have to sit in a witness box and answer questions as dozens of journalists looked on. On Tuesday morning, the jury had been sworn in and its members—six men and six women—stared out with interest at the packed room. In one case, an alternate juror, who looked slightly panicked, blurted out, “Sir, I can’t do this!” and was escorted out of the courtroom. In hindsight, he might as well have been speaking for Fox.Opening statements were supposed to be heard following lunch recess, but as reporters chatted and typed and furtively checked their e-mail and Twitter—Davis had been emphatic that spectators could not use their phones and suggested offenders could be held in contempt of court—the lawyers had still not begun delivering their remarks. After two hours, we were still waiting. The wooden benches in the two-hundred-person courtroom were uncomfortable—I overheard one Dominion attorney say they reminded him of going to Mass—and soon people were standing up, stretching, and trying to figure out what exactly was going on. My seatmates and I kept track of when Dominion and Fox’s lead attorneys entered and exited the room. Dominion’s lawyers, who had squeezed into the front row of the public seating area, legal boxes stuffed under their feet, seemed relaxed. They were whispering affably to one another and politely ignoring reporters’ attempts to chat them up. It was a little harder to tell what the Fox team was thinking. When Dan Webb, the network’s lead attorney, was in the courtroom, he sat, silent and stooped, facing away from the spectators.Suddenly, at around 3:50 P.M., the entire P.R. team for Dominion left the courtroom in a hurry. Judge Davis soon entered, and within a matter of minutes, he had announced the resolution, dismissed the jury, and thanked both Fox and Dominion for “the best lawyering” he’d seen in his years on the bench. Media reports, he said, had misconstrued his position somewhat—an oblique reference to the fact that outlets had reported on Davis’s occasional stern words for Webb. A statement from Fox soon arrived by e-mail: “We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” It was the sort of non-apology that only an enormous team of lawyers could write.At the press conference, Steven Shackelford, another Dominion attorney, told the assembled crowd, “Money is accountability. And we got that today from Fox.” The legal drama, however, wasn’t over for the cable news network. Smartmatic, another voting-machine company that was the subject of conspiracy theories in the wake of the 2020 election, is suing Fox News for $2.7 billion.“Is there anything else in this settlement besides money?” someone asked from the crowd. Would Fox air an apology? Issue a retraction? The Dominion team walked away from the microphone. As the crowd broke up, I hurried back toward my hotel. I saw Shackelford, from a distance, embrace a group that looked like it could be his family, then head up a hill away from the courthouse. I approached him, and introduced myself. “It’s a great day for my client,” he said. Shackelford had spent the whole day prepping for the opening statement he’d never delivered. He seemed genuinely giddy and did a comic exhalation of breath, bending over and sort of shaking out the sillies. I asked if we would see an on-air apology. Shackelford smiled and snapped back into friendly professionalism—he wasn’t the right person to ask.At my hotel entrance, Hootan Yaghoobzadeh, a co-founder of Staple Street Capital, Dominion’s owner, didn’t have an answer about an on-air apology, either. Ask the P.R. team, Yaghoobzadeh said. Dominion’s statement on behalf of its C.E.O., John Poulos, didn’t mention a public apology, but it was a little more direct than Fox had been: “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my Company, our employees, and our customers,” the statement read. At my hotel, I got to the elevator bay at the same time that an entire team of pleased-looking Dominion lawyers did. As they filed in, I introduced myself and wanted to know if they had any answer to my questions about apologies. Any chance they wanted to give me the kicker for my story? They all just smiled as the elevator door closed in my face. ♦New Yorker FavoritesAndy Warhol obsessively documented his life, but he also lied constantly, almost recreationally.A writer insisted that his novel was fiction, but a detective was sure it could help solve a murder.A major Black novelist made a remarkable début.

Author:By Kelly Ng\Published Date:2023-04-18\Content:Afghan economic hopes threatened by Taliban - UNPublished1 day agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Aid should not be linked to policies on women - Taliban officialBy Kelly NgBBC News, SingaporeWeak signs of recovery in Afghanistan's economy are at risk of being undone by Taliban restrictions on women working for NGOs, the UN says.Donations to the UN are under threat of falling sharply because of the ban on Afghan women working for it, the United Nations Development Programme said.The number of families living in poverty had nearly doubled in two years, its report found.The Taliban said politics should not be linked with humanitarian aid decisions. Afghanistan was pushed into economic collapse when the Taliban took over in 2021, and foreign funds that were being given to the previous regime were frozen. Already, 34 million people - 90% of the population - are living below the poverty line. Two in three Afghans don't know when they will get their next meal.The UNDP report noted signs of hope brought about by inflows of foreign aid through different UN agencies - coupled with improved security conditions, a reported reduction in corruption and better tax collection by the Taliban government. But it stressed: "The economy cannot be reignited if women cannot work, while future economic growth is constrained by under-investment in girls' and women's education."Image source, ReutersImage caption, Various organisations have criticised the Taliban for the disastrous impact of bans centred on womenLast year, the Taliban banned Afghan women from working for non-governmental organisations. Girls were also barred from secondary school and women from university. When the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in August 2021, billions of dollars in Afghan assets held abroad were frozen as the international community waited for the Taliban to honour promises on security, governance and human rights - including allowing all girls to be educated.The United Nations and other non-governmental organisations have since played a crucial role in saving Afghans from going hungry.But the UN said 94% of 127 national organisations it had surveyed had fully or partially ceased operations after the ban on women employees was imposed in December.About 150 NGOs and aid agencies have suspended all or part of their work.A senior Taliban finance ministry official told the BBC's Yogita Limaye in Kabul that the rules imposed on women were "internal matters" for the country and that their government was working to improve the economic situation. "All the humanitarian aid and donations on the ground, those should not be related to these issues only," said Mairaj Mohammad Mairaj, the ministry's director for general revenue."It is our duty as men, in the Islamic view, to take care of our women sitting in their homes."Mr Mairaj said there had been "a lot of corruption and misuse of power" in the previous government. "We have stopped ill-practices like bureaucracy, corruption from our departments - this was the reason we have a very well managed structure of revenue collection."We need not only aid - we need trade," he said. "We need the international community to come and work with us."'When I see the boys going to school, it hurts'BBC helps Afghan children banned from schoolTaliban to set new rules on women's aid work, UN saysCurrently, more than a million children, male and female, have been forced to leave school to provide for their families. Said Ali Akbar and his elder brother Ali Sena are among them. They hammer and weld away for nine hours each day in Kabul to earn just 150 Afghanis - less than $2. "I really like school. I miss it. This is very hard work, but I have got used to it now," Said Ali, who is 11, told the BBC. He dropped out of sixth grade last year. Their father lost his job when the economy collapsed and has now gone to Iran to find work. Their mother, Lila, begs on the streets. Image source, BBC NewsImage caption, Ali Sena and his mother Lila, during a work break"I feel awful that my young children are working. This is their time to study and be something. But life is hard for us. I am struggling to find work, and they have to provide for the family," Lila told the BBC.Some 84% of Afghanistan's 5.1 million households are having to borrow to pay for food, the UNDP report says.Earlier signs of recovery, such as a rise in exports, an expected increase in fiscal revenue, and a reduction in inflation - have been fuelled by international aid amounting to $3.7bn in 2022, according to the UNDP.UNDP simulations now suggest that if aid were to drop by 30%, gross domestic product (GDP) could contract by 0.4% in 2023 and the inflation rate might spike to about 10% in 2024. By that time, per capita incomes could decline to a projected $306, compared with $512 in 2020.Related TopicsAfghanistanWomen's rights in AfghanistanWomen's rightsTalibanUnited NationsHumanitarian aidMore on this storyUN condemns Taliban ban on its Afghan female staff5 AprilTaliban ban women from working at NGOs 'over hijab'24 December 2022Who are the Taliban?12 August 2022A year of violence on the road to peace28 February 2021

Author:Patrick Smith\Published Date:2023-04-18\Content:Link copiedApril 18, 2023, 5:31 PM UTCBy Patrick SmithA deadly conflict has suddenly erupted for control of Sudan, a resource-rich but impoverished nation, killing almost 200 civilians and raising fears it could spiral into a bitter civil war that would derail its hopes of democracy and threaten the stability of surrounding countries.The fighting erupted over the weekend between two rival groups led by two military leaders vying for power, leaving millions caught in the crossfire as airstrikes, shelling and gunfights hit the capital, Khartoum, and other areas.After a U.S. diplomatic convoy came under attack, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that he had spoken to the leaders of both sides and urged them to agree to a 24-hour cease-fire. Both leaders have agreed — but the news may only offer a temporary halt to an unpredictable clash.Here’s what to know about the fragile and complex situation in Africa’s third-largest country, from its warring generals to Russia’s Wagner mercenary group.The rival factions?The conflict is between the two powerful military leaders who had joined forces to thwart the country’s move toward democracy but have since turned into bitter rivals.Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan and his former deputy and current rival, Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.Getty; AFPIt pits the Sudanese military, controlled by the country’s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo — a former camel dealer widely known as Hemedti — who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Both men were leaders in a counterinsurgency against an uprising in Sudan’s Darfur region, a conflict that in 2005 saw dictator Omar al-Bashir become the world’s first sitting leader to be indicted by the International Criminal Court on suspicion of genocide.Then they were part of the military establishment that helped oust al-Bashir in 2019 after widespread popular unrest, raising hopes for democracy after his 30 years in power.But the two generals have remained major political figures in the extremely unstable years since then.They agreed to rule together in an alliance that saw the military seize power in a coup following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. The coup halted the move toward civilian rule and the armed forces have subsequently cracked down on pro-democracy activists.What led to the outbreak of fighting?The fighting of the last few days belies a complex national and international picture, in which ethnic and regional loyalties compete to control natural resources amid international influence, with major African and Middle Eastern powers joining the United States and Britain in attempting to steer the country’s political future.Hopes were raised among democracy campaigners in December when both generals signed a framework agreement with some 40 civil groups in which they promised to transition away from military rule.But now the alliance between the two military leaders has spectacularly broken down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government.Dagalo's paramilitary force began as brutal militias implicated in atrocities in the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s.Jacob Silberberg / Getty Images fileBoth sides disagree on how the RSF should be integrated into the military, a key condition of the framework agreement. The army wants the transition to happen in two years, while the RSF said it could take 10 years.Talks broke down and an April 11 deadline to sign an agreement came and went.RSF troops were posted across the country last Thursday — witnesses told Reuters that they saw a convoy of RSF vehicles including armored trucks enter Khartoum.The RSF said this was simply part of its normal duties in collaboration with the regular armed forces, but the Sudanese army issued a rare statement calling the move a “clear violation of law.”What’s the situation like on the ground?Fighting has been fierce in the capital and beyond since Saturday, with fighter jets launching airstrikes, artillery pounding and gunbattles for control of key sites such as military bases, the presidential palace and the state television building.Both sides accuse the other of being the first to shoot, but the picture is very murky and it’s unclear who might have the upper hand. Satellite images have illustrated the scale of the damage from the fighting, including here at Khartoum's international airport.AFP - Getty ImagesAn American travel writer, Lakshmi Parthasarathy, said she was awoken in Khartoum by what she thought was a thunderstorm. “It turned out it was gunshots, bombings, shelling,” she told NBC News.Residents have been forced to shelter in their homes, with shops shut and streets largely deserted.Fears are rising for the humanitarian situation in the country.An estimated 15 million people in Sudan face acute food insecurity out of a population of 46.7 million, but the U.N. World Food Program halted its work Sunday after three of its staff members were killed.And diplomatic workers have also come under fire.Blinken calls for cease-fire in Sudan after a U.S. diplomatic convoy was fired onApril 18, 202301:41Blinken told reporters Tuesday that a U.S. convoy with diplomatic plates, displaying an American flag, was shot at Monday, although no one was injured.“Indiscriminate military operations have resulted in significant civilian deaths and injuries, and are recklessly endangering the Sudanese people, diplomats including U.S. personnel, and humanitarian aid workers,” he said, reiterating calls for a halt to the fighting. What are the global stakes?Washington has traditionally had limited influence in Sudan, though this began to change after al-Bashir was ousted and the country began to move toward democracy.Sudan is an important regional political player and also has strategic ports and vast natural resources, such as gold and oil, coveted at home and abroad.Neighboring Egypt has deep links with the Sudanese military, while both the military and the RSF have forged close ties to regional power players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But a growing force in recent years throughout the region has been Russia and the Kremlin-backed mercenary Wagner Group, which is also fighting in eastern Ukraine and has been linked to gold trafficking in Sudan.Earlier this year Russia finalized a deal with Sudan’s military leaders to build a naval base on the country’s Red Sea coast, where it would keep up to four ships, including nuclear-powered ones, and up to 300 troops.Dating back to 2021, the deal was waiting to be ratified by the incoming Sudanese civilian government — an outcome that now looks increasingly unlikely.“The Russians have been trying to advance relations with both of the military camps over the last three years,” said Joseph Siegle, director of research for the Africa Center of Strategic Studies, a think tank in Washington. “They’ve been mostly positive” toward Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, he said. “But they have also been especially positive toward Hemedti, who has been the one controlling the gold mines.” Russia's foreign minister met with Dagalo in Khartoum earlier this year as Moscow vies with the West for influence in Africa.AFP - Getty ImagesSudan’s economy has been deteriorating, leaving the country’s civilians facing hardship and its rulers in a precarious position looking for help from abroad. The military controls most of the country’s economy, but the RSF runs major gold mining areas, adding a financial element to a complex political crisis.“There’s 300% inflation, a contracting economy, it’s hard to get basic goods and supplies. So there’s a lot of economic pressure, and that’s the main driving force for the military to consider this transition — they just don’t have the credibility or legitimacy,” Siegle said of the faltering move toward democracy.With Sudan’s fate uncertain, so is the global fallout.“The military leadership split upends the calculations and hopes not only of the Sudanese population hoping for democracy and new infusions of foreign assistance, but also of the regional and global players pursuing sometimes competing agendas in Sudan,” said the Soufan Center, an intelligence and security consultancy, in a briefing note. Either way, it concluded: “A return to stability or civilian rule is unlikely in the near to medium term.”Patrick SmithPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.Leila Sackur, Charlene Gubash and Associated Press contributed.Link copiedApril 18, 2023, 5:31 PM UTCBy Patrick SmithA deadly conflict has suddenly erupted for control of Sudan, a resource-rich but impoverished nation, killing almost 200 civilians and raising fears it could spiral into a bitter civil war that would derail its hopes of democracy and threaten the stability of surrounding countries.The fighting erupted over the weekend between two rival groups led by two military leaders vying for power, leaving millions caught in the crossfire as airstrikes, shelling and gunfights hit the capital, Khartoum, and other areas.After a U.S. diplomatic convoy came under attack, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that he had spoken to the leaders of both sides and urged them to agree to a 24-hour cease-fire.
